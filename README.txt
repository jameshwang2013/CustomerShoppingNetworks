A. Case Overview

Our client has data on which customers shop together. We can employ link/network analysis to create features and study how network attributes affect revenues generated by a customer and his/her network.

B. Folders and Files

FOLDERS
- “0. Raw Data” contains the raw data files that were originally sent over to me
- “1. Documentation” contains documentation that was originally sent over to me as well as my own documentation on how to approach this project.
- “2. Results” contains the .csv files written out by my R scripts
- “3. Presentation” contains slide deck used during presentation
- “4. Visuals” any visual aids and graphs/plots used in my presentation
- “5. Archive” any retired files/folders from the project process.

FILES
- “links.csv” - copy of the raw data sent to me. Contains list of edges as well as zip code and strength of each edge.
- “nodes.csv” - copy of the raw data sent to me. Contains each node (customer) ID (integer) and the revenue they generated in a given year.
- “random_names.csv” mapping of a unique string label to each node. Makes interpreting the nodes and subgraphs in R easier.
- “zip_codes_age_popdense.csv” - manual scraping from web for zip code attributes
- “zip_codes_data.csv” - automated scraping from web for zip code attributes (written out from the .py script “income_data_scraper.py”)
- “zip_codes.csv” - list of zip code names

SCRIPTS
- “income_data_scraper.py” - Python (2.7) script using BeautifulSoup to parse web data for zip code attributes. Outputs “zip_codes_data.csv”
- “relationshipsAnalysis.R” - R script to analyze the relationships between customers (see Link Analysis Results II in presentation deck)
- “revenueAnalysis_fullGraph_InterZipcode.R” - R script to analyze the relevant network attributes that would impact revenue the most on the full graph and inter-zipcode level (see Link Analysis Results I: Tactics 1 through 3 in presentation deck). Note: inter-zipcode level results never made it into the presentation (see “2. Results > Coefficients > 98101_results…98199_results” folders for inter-zipcode level results. See “full_graph_results” in Coefficients folder for full graph results).
- “revenueAnalysis_IntraZipcode.R” R script to analyze the relevant network attributes and zipcode demographic attributes ACROSS zipcodes (see Link Analysis Results: Tactic 4 in presentation deck). See “2. Results > Coefficients > zipcode_results” for .csv file of results.


##################################
C. Methodology

1. Data Collection
- “links.csv” and “nodes.csv” provided by “client”
- “zip_codes_age_popdense.csv” and “zip_codes_data.csv” were manually and automatically scraped from web sources

2. Data Pre-processing, feature engineering, model training and evaluation
- see Appendix of presentation deck
